# Roll-A-Ballbylon

This is me, learning Babylon, through iterative features on a Roll-a-ball game.

Shout out to [this babylon Typescript Starter](https://github.com/oktinaut/babylonjs-typescript-starter) for making 0-to-go simple.

## Show me!

Check out [the live demo](https://rollaballsteve.blob.core.windows.net/$web/index.html)

## Local dev

After clone simply:

* `npm install` (or `npm ci`)
* `npm start`

And navigate to `localhost:9000`
