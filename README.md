# Roll-A-Ballbylon

This is me, learning Babylon, through iterative features on a Roll-a-ball game.

Shout out to [this babylon Typescript Starter](https://github.com/oktinaut/babylonjs-typescript-starter) for making 0-to-go simple.

## Usage

I haven't set up automated deploy, so after clone simply:

* `npm install` (or `npm ci`)
* `npm start`

And navigate to `localhost:9000`
